# ZeroDivisionError in Python Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains a function that can raise this error if the second argument is zero. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function that handles this case gracefully.

## How to Reproduce the Error
Run `bug.py` to see the ZeroDivisionError. 

## Solution
The solution is to add error handling to the function.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to use a `try-except` block to catch the error and handle it appropriately.
